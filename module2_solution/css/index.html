                    Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Overseas Chinese who have settled in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, \
                    and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide.

                   Pasta is usually made from wheat, but Asian noodles may be made from other starch ingredients. The means by which pasta was introduced into Europe remains uncertain. For many years people claimed that pasta was brought to Europe by the 
                    explorer Marco Polo when he returned from Asia in 1295.
